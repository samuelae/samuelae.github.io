## German Small World of Words
Working on extending the [German version of the Small World of Words](https://smallworldofwords.org/de) project collecting free associations to thousands of German words. Participate in just 7 minutes, there are also versions in other languages.

## SDG Hackathon
Helped organize the SDG Hackathon - Visualizing Swiss Sustainability Research in November 2021 and built website [sdghackathon.io](https://sdghackathon.io) for it. It was a lot of fun to set everyting up and very gratifying to see the many visualizations being uploaded in the last minutes before the deadline.

## NUMERAI
Running a [prediction model](https://numer.ai/descai) on the NUMERAI data science tournament. Thinking I will revise the model soon for a couple of years now.
